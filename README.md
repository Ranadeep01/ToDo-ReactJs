# ToDo-ReactJs

This is a simple ToDo list application built with ReactJS. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, undo, edit their task and delete them. The application stores the tasks in the browser's local storage.

### Features

- Add a new task: Users can enter a task description in the input field at the top of the page and click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

- Mark a task as completed: Users can click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed. This will visually highlight the task as completed on the page.

- Delete a task: Users can click on the trash can icon next to a task to delete it from the list.

- Filter tasks: Users can filter the tasks by status (completed or not completed) using the dropdown menu at the top of the page.

- Clear all completed tasks: Users can click on the "Clear completed" button at the bottom of the page to delete all completed tasks from the list.

- Edit a task: Users can double-click on a task to edit its description. The task will turn into an input field where the user can modify the task description. Clicking outside of the input field or pressing the Enter key will save the changes.

- Drag and drop reordering: Users can drag and drop tasks to reorder them in the list. The new order will be saved in the browser's local storage.
